<p>Android allows applications to publish views to be embedded in other applications.  These
views are called widgets, and are published by "AppWidget providers."  The component that can
contain widgets is called a "AppWidget host."

documentation in the Dev Guide.</p>

<h2><a name="providers"></a>AppWidget Providers</h2>
<p>Any application can publish widgets.  All an application needs to do to publish a widget is
to have a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} that receives the {@link
android.appwidget.AppWidgetManager#ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE AppWidgetManager.ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE} intent,
and provide some meta-data about the widget.  Android provides the
{@link android.appwidget.AppWidgetProvider} class, which extends BroadcastReceiver, as a convenience
class to aid in handling the broadcasts.


<h2>AppWidget Hosts</h3>
<p>Widget hosts are the containers in which widgets can be placed.  Most of the look and feel
details are left up to the widget hosts.  For example, the home screen has one way of viewing
widgets, but the lock screen could also contain widgets, and it would have a different way of
adding, removing and otherwise managing widgets.</p>
<p>For more information on implementing your own widget host, see the
{@link android.appwidget.AppWidgetHost AppWidgetHost} class.</p>
