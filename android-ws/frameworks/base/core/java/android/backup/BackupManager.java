/**
 * BackupManager is the interface to the system's backup service.
 * Applications simply instantiate one, and then use that instance
 * to communicate with the backup infrastructure.
 *
 * <p>When your application has made changes to data it wishes to have
 * backed up, call {@link #dataChanged()} to notify the backup service.
 * The system will then schedule a backup operation to occur in the near
 * future.  Repeated calls to {@link #dataChanged()} have no further effect
 * until the backup operation actually occurs.
 *
 * <p>The backup operation itself begins with the system launching the
 * {@link android.app.BackupAgent} subclass declared in your manifest.  See the
 * documentation for {@link android.app.BackupAgent} for a detailed description
 * of how the backup then proceeds.
